    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://gohyer.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">Hyer</a></h3>
        <p>Hyer's website looks clean. its easy to follow along and see all they have to offer</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent contrast between text and background for readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> same font and color scheme throughout.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> elements are alligned alternating left and right sides between sections so its easy to tell youre in a new topic area.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> they did a good job sectioning things together that should be and keeping it simple</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, Hyer follows the CRAP principles and have created a user-friendly experience that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p>

    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://blinkee.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">blinkee</a></h3>
        <p>blinkee's website has awful contrast, some of the words are blurry, and no links has the hover effect making it difficult to use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> dummy contrast makes text hard to read against the wild background.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> their colors are all over the place and it makes the page look chaotic.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> everything can move with the mouse. they basically have two footers on the page in different areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Items that should be grouped are scattered errywher.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, Angelfire does not adhere to the CRAP principles, resulting in a frustrating user experience with a lack of visual coherence.</p>
